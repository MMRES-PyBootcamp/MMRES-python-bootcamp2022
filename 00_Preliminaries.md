# 0 Preliminary Requirements for BIST Python Bootcamp  
  
Welcome to the BIST Python Bootcamp! So, what do we hope to achieve? We aim to provide you with the extremely powerful tool of programming languages for data analysis without any previous experience requirements.  

Programming languages allow us to analyse much larger datasets with a broader toolkit in terms of numerical analysis and data visualisation that what we obtain with spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. For those who are not familiar either with programming or Python, even though it may be slower at the beginning, as we become more proficient in with it, it is much easier and faster to work with data this way. Hopefully, by the end of this bootcamp, you will have a firm grasp of programming in Python, with a clear idea of how to use it for data analysis and visualisation. Going forward, you should have a strong grounding in programming and might wish to develop skills in data mining or computational modelling - useful skills for science and other careers. 

Beyond providing you with specific Python knowledge, we also aim to teach you good programming practices, like version control. This will include setting up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, as described in the last section. We will cover this throughout the course, though you are more than welcome to try it out before hand and download the course's contents before we start. 

Before the bootcamp, it will be very helpful if you could install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) on your computer, as described in the section below, which should set you up nicely for the course and hopefully any data analysis you need to do during your Masters. We have some optional resources for those [coming to Python from either Matlab or R](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf), or those who are [new to programming](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). For the ones already experienced in Python, you are more than welcome to join and learn some new tricks. Finally, all students are encouraged to work together and help each other!

## Installing Python3 on your Computer  

You may already have Python 3 installed on your computer (especially if you have a Mac or Linux distribution). However, we recommend installing [Anaconda Python 3.9](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which nicely supports Windows, Mac and Linux machines and will include the right version of Python with all the scientific packages needed for this bootcamp. If you have problems with the installation and Google is no help, we will do our best to help you in the first session of the bootcamp. 

Now that you have Python installed on your computer, you may want to try it out. The easiest way is to open an Anaconda Prompt terminal and type `python`. This will let you introduce Python commands. You may try with:

+ `2+2`
+ `print('Hello, world!')`
+ `import numpy`

If you got no errors, you are almost ready to start the bootcamp! If you got any error, fear not, we will cover it in the first session of the bootcamp. Now to exit the Python mode, you can type `exit()` and hit enter. 

## Installing Git on your Computer

Git is a version control software that allows us to keep track of the history of our code, data, and documents. Using Git is extremely helpful even when working alone and it becomes essential to collaborate with a team on a common project (your bootcamp teachers created all the contents of the course by collaborating on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2022).). So we strongly encourage you to [sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/signup?user_email=&source=form-home-signup) and start getting used to Git just from now!

**Read this if you are Windows User**: Usually, Windows PCs don't have Git by default and you need to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

To download the course materials, open a Git Bash command line and run `$ git clone https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2022`. This command would download the MMRES-python-bootcamp2022 repository from GitHub with all the contents we will need along the bootcamp.

If you don't feel confident enough to work with the Git command line, there is software like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) providing visual interface that allows us to manage our Git repositories without typing commands (you can start using Git with the visual interface and, as you get more comfortable, gradually switch to the command line).
